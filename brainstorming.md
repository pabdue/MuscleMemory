## New App Ideas - Evaluate and Categorize
1. Workout Tracker
   - **Description**: Allows users to record their workouts and keep track of what exercises were done on which days. Able to track exercise name, weight used, number of repetitions/sets, and date/time completed.
   - **Category:** Health & Fitness
   - **Mobile:** Mobile is essential for the instant logging of different exercises during a workout session. Users can quickly view their workout history anywhere, anytime.
   - **Story:** The app is centered around the compelling narrative of personal improvement and fitness journey tracking. It appeals to individuals committed to fitness, offering them a robust tool to monitor their progress, stay motivated, and consistently improve. Friends and peers, particularly those interested in fitness, would find the idea appealing as it supports their goals with tangible, trackable metrics.
   - **Market:** The fitness app market is substantial and growing, driven by increasing health awareness and the popularity of wearable devices. While the market is competitive, a workout tracker with a simple UI and is free, will attract many people. The potential user base includes gym goers, fitness enthusiasts, and the everyday person who needs help tracking their fitness journey.
   - **Habit:** This app is designed to be highly habit-forming. Users are encouraged to log every workout session, track their progress over time, and receive notifications if they miss a scheduled workout. The app also involves content creation, as users record details of their workouts and potentially share these with friends or on social media. Daily interaction is expected, with weekly summaries and suggestions for improvement based on past performance keeping users engaged and returning regularly
   - **Scope:** The scope of the app is defined with core features such as workout logging, progress tracking, and user notifications. The technical challenges include creating an easy to use UI that promotes seamless process in logging exercise information. A stripped-down version of the app could focus primarily on basic workout logging and tracking, which still presents an interesting project to build and can be effectively demonstrated by the end of your program. This version can later be expanded to include more sophisticated features like camera integration and a community/social aspect.

2. Street Vendor Map
   - **Description:** Allows vendors to pin their location and advertise what they are selling. Users can search for "tacos" and see the nearest vendors that are selling tacos, and other food.
   - **Category:** Food
   - **Mobile:** The Street Vendor Map app is designed to leverage mobile-specific features effectively. It uses GPS technology to display real-time locations of street vendors, allowing users to find nearby food options quickly. The app integrates mapping technology to help users navigate to vendors and plan their routes directly. It also offers live updates on vendorsâ€™ locations and menus, essential for mobile vendors who frequently change spots. Additionally, push notifications inform users about new vendors and updates from favorites, enhancing the app's utility for users on the move. These mobile-centric features make the app a practical and superior choice compared to a standard website.
   - **Story:** The Street Vendor Map app tells the story of connecting local communities with nearby street food vendors, fostering local economies and offering a convenient way to access diverse culinary options. It appeals to food enthusiasts and regular patrons of street food, providing them with instant updates and a dynamic directory of local eats. This concept would resonate well among peers and potential users who value convenience, local business support, and gastronomic adventure.
   - **Market:** The market potential for this app is significant, particularly in urban areas where street food culture is prominent. It targets not only food lovers but also vendors who can benefit from increased visibility and foot traffic. By tapping into this niche yet widespread interest, the app can cater to a large audience looking for quick and easy ways to find fresh, local food while also serving as an essential tool for vendors to reach more customers.
   - **Habit:** This app is designed to be used frequently, whenever users feel the urge to explore new eating options or when vendors need to update their current location and menu. Regular use is encouraged by the real-time nature of the content and the constantly changing positions of vendors. Users not only consume information but also interact with the app by leaving reviews, saving their favorite vendors, or following specific vendors to receive updates.
   - **Scope:** The scope of the app is well-defined with a focus on real-time location tracking, vendor and menu listings, user reviews, and social sharing capabilities. The technical challenges involve integrating with real-time GPS tracking, developing a reliable mapping interface, and ensuring timely updates are displayed accurately. A simplified version could initially only include map integration and basic vendor information, which is still interesting and functional for a first release. More advanced features such as social integration, personalized notifications, and enhanced search functionalities can be developed later.
