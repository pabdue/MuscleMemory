## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I was having trouble with my list. Whenever I would click the completed button for some reason my list would update but it would duplicate the task. Same goes for editing a task. 
If i wanted to edit the task I would then have a duplicate appear. What fixed this error for me was updating the constants in the task file to just variables.
